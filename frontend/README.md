# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project is now built using **Vite** instead of Create React App, providing a faster and more efficient development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `bun run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `bun run build`

Builds the app for production inside the `dist` folder.
Vite optimizes the build for better performance.

### `bun run preview`

Serves the production build locally to test before deployment.
